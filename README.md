# Digital-Health-Literacy-Companion-Tool-Lakeland-Regional-Health-
This project aims to develop a digital health literacy companion that replaces generic discharge handouts with interactive, patient-specific guidance. It will use clear language, multimedia, and offer reminders or follow-up support. It must be usable by patients with low digital literacy and integrate with existing hospital systems.
